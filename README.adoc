= Azure Serverless Architecture with Terraform

== Terraform

Following the standard naming convention in Terraform, we will define our infrastructure module within 4 files:

```
❯ tree terraform
terraform
├── main.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
└── variables.tf
```

* main.tf is where the cloud resources and their configuration will be defined.
* variables.tf is for definitions of variables used in main.tf.
* terraform.tfvars is for actual values of variables from varaibles.tf.
* outputs.tf lists the values that main.tf should report back to the user.

=== Variables

To make our module reusable, we can define a list of variables (you can think about them as of input arguments) it supports.
Later we will reference them within the module.
Each variable declaration consists of a name at minimum, but also can specify variable type, description and default value.
Let's add 3 variables:

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/variables.tf[]
----

=== Variables Values

Terraform will automatically load all .tf and .tfvars files in the module's directory.
Latter is to specify values for module variables defined in the previous step.
Alternatively you can pass them as command line arguments or with environment variables.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/env/.dev.tfvars[]
----

=== Provider

You deploy Terraform module to a provider.
Obvious provider examples are cloud providers like AWS/GCP/Azure but there are many more.
You can manage resources and configuration in Digital Ocean, Heroku, Github and Netlfy.
See the full list of providers in the

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/providers.tf[]
----

=== Resource Group

Resource Group is a logical container to organize resources together and manage permissions in Azure.
Each resource must belong to a single resource group.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/main.tf[tags=azurerm_resource_group]
----

=== Storage Account

Storage account is another resource required for our function app.
It will host the file system of the container running our function app.
This is where the code will be uploaded as well as where logs and any temporary files will be written to.

*Notes*:

* Storage account naming convention is an exception to the rule since Azure doesn't allow - in the name
* We reference the resource group created in the previous step.
This also signals to Terraform in which order to create resources so that dependencies are properly resolved.
* LRS stands for "Locally redundant storage" where your data is replicated within a single region.
A more advanced setting here is ZRS which is "Zone-redundant storage".

[source,hcl-terraform]

include::terraform/main.tf[tags=azurerm_storage_account]
----

=== Application Insights

Application Insights is a component of Azure Monitor which allows you to collect metrics and logs from your function app.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/main.tf[tags=azurerm_application_insights]
----

=== App Service Plan

A Function App must always be associated with an App Service Plan which defines the compute resources available to the FA and how it scales.

There are 3 plans available:

* Consumption Plan.
Serverless, scales automatically with the number of events.
No events => zero instances (you pay nothing).
* Premium Plan.
You reserve a number of always-ready instances which run no matter if there are events or not.
As load grows, new instances are added automatically.
* Dedicated (App Service) Plan.
FAs will run on VMs managed by you.
Doesn't scale automatically based on events.

Naming is a bit unfortunate here since the 3rd option has "App Service Plan" in it too.
We want to go serverless thus we choose a Linux Consumption App Service Plan. sku section below sets it.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
include::terraform/main.tf[tags=azurerm_app_service_plan]
----

=== Function App

The final resource we need to create is the function app itself.
It references resources created earlier: App Service Plan, Application Insights instance and storage account.
Version is set to 3, which is the latest version of Azure Functions at the moment.

app_settings is a key-value block with configuration options for all of the functions in the Function App.
If you need to pass an environment variable to your code, add it here.

If you publish code with other tools (e.g. Azure Functions Core Tools, or VS Code, or use ZIP deploy directly), they may change the value of WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE.
To prevent Terraform from reporting about configuration drift in these cases, we set the app setting to an empty value and ignore changes in the lifecycle block.
Note: alternatively you can deploy the function code with Terraform too - there won't be this issue then.

For CORS configuration, check the cors parameter in the resource documentation.

[source,hcl-terraform]

=== Terraform Output

We have all the components defined in Terraform now.
Once we deploy the module we want to know the hostname of our function app to make a test call.
We also need the Azure name of the function app for the next step where we deploy the function code.

[source,hcl-terraform]

include::terraform/outputs.tf[]

=== Verify infrastructure is deployed

Open the function app hostname in the browser.
You should see the success page:
